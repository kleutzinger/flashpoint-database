## URL Format

Shared playlists use a URL format that includes the playlist name:
```
https://yoursite.com/?name=My%20Awesome%20Playlist&id=game1&id=game2&id=game3
```

Where:
- `name` parameter contains the playlist name (URL encoded)
- Each `id` parameter contains a game ID from the Flashpoint database

The playlist name is automatically included when sharing, so recipients don't need to manually enter it.

## Technical Details

- **Static Site**: No server required, works entirely in the browser
- **Local Storage**: Playlists are saved using browser localStorage
- **Flashpoint API**: Uses the existing Flashpoint database API
- **Game Launching**: Integrates with ooooooo.ooo for game playback
